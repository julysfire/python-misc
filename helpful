Most efficient way to do lots of if-elif statements?

Sometimes I use a dictionary and dict.get for this kind of stuff.

OPTIONS = {
    "1": whatever,
    "2": whatever2,
    "3": whatever3,
}

choice = input("number.. ")
selection = OPTIONS.get(choice)

if selection == None:
    print("Try again")
    
    
    
    5 Interesting Python Modules
These are some modules that might not have day-to-day use for Python programmers but are still fun to try out and experiment with. Here are the modules:

Wikipedia - It turns out that you can import the whole Wikipedia into your Python Program! Simply run pip install wikipedia on your computer and import the module. There are multiple functions in the module such as summary(), search(), set_lang() which can be used to create multiple interesting projects. More info at https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/
Emoji - This is a cool module that you can use to add emojis to your project. The emojis will be displayed in the command line for your project. To install it, run pip install emoji. More info at https://pypi.org/project/emoji/
Turtle - This is one of the most well-known interesting Python modules. It comes pre-installed with the default Python3 package. Import turtle for graphics and simple 2d games. This is a module primarily used for creating graphics and cool visuals. More info at https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle

Visual Studio and Python -- Extensions and helpful

When you're starting out like me learning Python, these are the 12 recommended extensions that I currently have installed. I hope it helps you in your learning journey as it is doing wonders for me:

Bracket Pair Colorizer
indent-rainbow
Python
Python Docstring Generator
Python Preview
Trailing Spaces
Visual Studio Intellicode
Gitlens
Docker
Dracula Theme
Material Icon Theme
Settings Sync

Let me know if you have other cool extensions that I can add.

Thanks!

Edit:

Added: Gitlens (for those already learned git/github), Docker (only install if you learned Docker), Material Icon Theme, Settings Sync, Dracula Theme

Considerations:
Themes: Monokai Pro (very cool, I tried it), Material (most popular)
Code-Assistant/Auto-Complete: Kite, TabNine
Webdev: Minify, Prettier, Paste JSON as Code (for those learning html, css and js)
Removed: vscode-icons (sorry microsoft), Code Spell Checker (confusing with other syntax errors)



A small collection of snippets that I use quite frequently. Feel free to use them for whatever you want. Go crazy!
